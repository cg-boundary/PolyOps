**Introducing, PolyOps.**
There are many tools to explore but check below for a few samples and everything else you need can be found from following the links at the bottom.

And **yes** this addon is **free**, however if you enjoy the product or any other content I release please consider getting an appreciation token from my GumRoad page (Link at the bottom).

*Mesh Ops Menu*<br />
The HUD Hot Bar option is the icons across the top of the screen, they can be moved around to your preferred location, toggle on or off, and flipped vertically if needed. All of the HUD Hot Bar options can be found in the menu and only act as a quick access point. Hovering your mouse of the tool for a moment will make the tool tips menu popup allowing you to read more options.
In the image below, hovering the mouse over the Merge tool lets you know that Edit Mode is required, the (LMB) Radial means Left Mouse Button clicking the tool will launch it in Radial mode, but the (SHIFT) Edge means holding shift while clicking the button will auto launch the tool in Edge mode. This is a common theme across this addon!

*Settings Menu*<br />
The sorting section can be a little tricky to understand at first but here is a simple run down.
The "Top" section is for what modifiers should be put at the top of the modifier stack, it also ask for what conditions must be met for it to be considered, and then if everything checks out it will move the modifier. There is also the sort limit which controls how many qualifying modifiers of that type it is allowed to move. The "Middle" and "Bottom" sections have explanations included in the menu but "Middle" is for unsorted Booleans only and "Bottom" is for modifiers you always want to appear last.

*Modifiers Menu*<br />
Apply has several options that can be accessed with Shift Clicking or Ctrl Clicking and so on, it's all in the tool tip. Sort can be used to quickly sort modifiers based on the Settings defined in the Sort tab from the Settings Menu. Object Shading can add or remove Auto Smooth and Weighted Normals, it also handles shading any Boolean Mesh objects for you.

*Curve Ops Menu*<br />
Mesh to Curves will take the current selected edges and create a curve object from the selection launching the adjustment tool.  Adjust Curve will let you adjust the curves after the fact.

*Scene Menu*<br />
Here you can set the render engine and a High Quality (HQ) or Low Quality (LQ) profile.
So in the redo panel you can see all the settings that can be adjusted, in this case I selected EEVEE and did not hold down shift meaning it selected the HQ settings profile.

*Addon Preferences*<br />
Some notable settings in the preferences would be under settings, you can change the main menu hot key which is Q by default. Several addons use this key since it is not used by Blender and this addon does not or will not consider accommodations for other addons to a high degree. I simply do not have time to sift through probable collisions.
Another notable area is under the "Info" tab, here you can see all the hot keys used.
